## Jenkins CICD PipeLine Script

Jenkins CICD Pipeline script is a script written in Groovy that defines a set of instructions and stages to be executed in order to set up a Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery (CICD) pipeline. 

A CICD pipeline is an automated process that allows developers to build, test and deploy software applications quickly and reliably. The Jenkins CICD Pipeline script is typically used to define the stages of the pipeline, including code checkout, build, test and deploy. 

It can also be used to define parameters that can be used to control the execution of the pipeline, such as environment variables and options.
